# Overview

This repo is a fork of ["Tensorflow for poets 2"](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/tensorflow-for-poets-2)

# Purpose
This repo was made/forked to try out image classification and get started with tensorflow.
The retraining here was to use MobileNet to classify one of the three main lifts in powerlifting competition:
1. The barbell squat
2. The bench press
3. The deadlift

Images were downloaded via Google Chrome.
The tflite folder can also be used for an Android app version.
